## 🌿 Potato Leaf Disease Classification using CNN

This is a Simple project predicts whether a potato leaf has a disease using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. It classifies leaves into one of three categories:
- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**
- **Healthy**
> **Note:** Try to perform more epochs. Although I tried running it on Google Colab, my system tends to hang.

### ✨ Features
- Deep Learning-based Classification
- Real-time Image Prediction using **Streamlit**
- Image Processing with **OpenCV**
- Data Manipulation using **Pandas** and **NumPy**
- Visualization with **Matplotlib**

### 📅 Dataset
- The dataset for this project was obtained from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)**, containing labeled images of potato leaves.
